Generate dynamic sitemaps for all active languages and post types using Polylang in WordPress.

== Description ==

Polylang Dynamic Sitemap Generator is a WordPress plugin that automatically generates sitemaps for all active languages and post types in your Polylang-powered multilingual website. It ensures that your website's sitemap stays up to date with the latest content and reflects the structure of your multilingual website.

The plugin utilizes the Polylang plugin to determine the active languages. It fetches all published posts and pages for each language and generates separate sitemap files for each language. Additionally, it creates a main sitemap.xml file that lists the language-based sitemaps.

The sitemaps follow the XML Sitemap protocol and include the URL, last modification date, and change frequency for each post. The generated sitemaps can be submitted to search engines to improve the indexing of your website.
